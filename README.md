FOSS Restaurant kitchen management

## Summary

This is intended to be a simple kitchen management software, capable of:

 - Maintaining a database of Products used in the restaurant, with their prices.
 - Storing a cookbook with the Recipes those products are being used in.
 - Keeping a list with the Menus served in the restaurant.
 - Propagating the price changes in the Products to the Recipes and Menus automatically.
 
The scope of the project is quite modest, and we are only targeting small and medium sized kitchens. Once we are done with out initial feature set, we will start developing feature requests.


This software is completely freeware, and will always be.

The software was originally developed for the Albergue de Villaba in Pamplona, Spain. You can visit their website at:

## Current status
(March 2015) - We are still developing the software, and most of the functionality is still missing. But we are working on it! We expect an initial release around May this year.
